    <h1>Internship by Skolar</h1>
    <h2>This is sample html file done during training</h2>
    <h3>I'm a student pursuing the training</h3>
    <h4>This is the topic where we are discussing about headings tag</h4>
    <h5>The headings become smaller and smaller by increasing the numbers like h1 is the much bigger one and all the others starts decreasing in the size</h5>
    <h6>This is the heading where the size is so small</h6>
    <p>This is a paragraph tag where we can write many words and also we can provide a link in the paragraph tag by using the anchor tag 'a'. Here is an example of anchor tag <a href="https://www.google.com">link </a> href is the word which we use for adding any links or URL's in the anchor tag </p>

    <ul>
        <li>There are three types in list</li>
        <li>Ordered List</li>
        <li>Unordered List</li>
        <li>Descriptive List</li>
        

    </ul>

    <ol>
        <li>In Ordered List,the list is represented by using the Numbers</li>
        <li>In Unordered List there will be points or dots or bullets</li>
        <li>DescriptiveList is a list where we can add paragraph</li>

    </ol>
    <dl>
        <dt>HTML</dt>
        <dd>In Description List we have other two tags they 'dt' and 'dd' in dt we give the main title of the paragraph and in dd we write the data about the heading</dd>
    </dl>
